        The Pomeranian (<span> often known as a Pom </span>) is a breed of dog of the Spitz type that is named for the
        Pomerania
        region in north-west Poland and north-east Germany in Central Europe. Classed as a toy dog breed because of
        its small size, the Pomeranian is descended from the larger Spitz-type dogs, specifically the German Spitz. It
        has been determined by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale to be part of the German Spitz breed; and in
        many countries, they are known as the Zwergspitz ("Dwarf-Spitz"). Victoria owned a particularly small
        Pomeranian and consequently, the smaller variety became universally
        popular.

        Victoria's lifetime alone, the size of the breed had decreased by half. Overall, the Pomeranian is a sturdy,
        healthy dog. The most common health issues are luxating patella and tracheal collapse. More rarely, the breed
        can have Alopecia X, a skin condition colloquially known as "black skin disease". This is a genetic disease
        which causes the dog's skin to turn black and lose all or most of its hair.[1] As of 2013, in terms of
        registration figures, since at least 1998, the breed has ranked among the top twenty most popular breeds in
        the USA, and the current fashion for small dogs has increased their popularity worldwide.
        Pomeranians are small dogs weighing 1.9–3.5 kilograms (4.2–7.7 lb) and standing 5.0–11 inches
        (13–28 cm) high
        at the withers.[2] They are compact but sturdy dogs with an abundant textured coat with a highly plumed tail
        set high and flat.[3] The top coat forms a ruff of fur on the neck, which Poms are well known for, and they
        also have a fringe of feathery hair on the hindquarters.[4]

        century.[5]

        In modern times, the Pomeranian comes in the widest variety of colors of any dog breed, including white, black,
        brown, red, orange, cream, blue, sable, black and tan, brown and tan, spotted, brindle, plus combinations of
        those colors.[6] The most common colors are orange, black or cream/white.[3]
